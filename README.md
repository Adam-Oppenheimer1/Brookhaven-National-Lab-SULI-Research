Project done in Brookhaven National Lab as a SULI intern in Summer 2023. I focused on analyzing reactor antineutrino spectra, trying to explain discrepancies between new data and theoretical models.
The focus was to look at the 'summation model' which added contributions from all of the radioactive isotopes within a nuclear reactor to determine the antineutrino spectra released from said nuclear reactors.
The majority of this research was conducted through modifying the terms used in the summation model to try and emulate the odd features seen in the experimental data, as an alternate explanation to 'sterile neutrinos',
which other groups theorized was the cause of said discrepancies.

Research ended up finding a few nucleotides which _were_ able to explain some of this discrepancy, supporting further research into this subject
